# Part 1: Introduction to Telegram Bot

Welcome to Part 1 of the A2SV Remote Second Year Telegram Bot Development Phase! In this section, we'll delve into the fundamentals of creating a Telegram bot, understanding the recommended folder structure, and exploring the concept of long polling. By the end of this exercise, you'll have a solid foundation to build your first Telegram bot using the Aiogram library.

## Getting Started

To begin this exercise, follow these detailed steps (If you haven't done them already):

1. **Clone the Repository / Open the github Codespace:**
   - Use GitHub Codespace for a consistent development environment.
   - Or Clone the repository to your local 

2. **Create Your Branch:**
   - Ensure platform consistency by creating a new branch with the format `[First_Name].[Task].1`.
   - **Task:** Run the command `git checkout -b YourName.Task.1` to create your branch.

3. **Copy Task Folder:**
   - Your submission should be inside the Part_1 directory and it should be within a directory called [Your_first_name]
   - **Task:** After finishing your task, make sure to add a readme and add your deployed bot name to it.
