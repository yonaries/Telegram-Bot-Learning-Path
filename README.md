# Group 4 A2SV Remote Second Year Telegram Bot Development Phase

## Introduction

Welcome to the Group 4 A2SV Remote Second Year Telegram Bot Development Phase. Throughout this phase, students will embark on a guided journey, progressively building a fully functional Telegram bot. This hands-on experience will lead each learner through essential concepts and topics, providing a comprehensive understanding of:
- Aiogram Library
- Long Polling
- Finite State Machine
- ReplyKeyboard, InlineKeyboard, and callbacks
- Webhook (optional)

In this phase, we'll cover essential topics, and although we won't delve into advanced concepts, learners interested in exploring Telegram bot development further can find additional carefully selected resources in the 'Additional Resources' section.

## Getting Started

### 1.Clone this repository
    ` git clone https://github.com/blenassefa2/Telegram-Bot-Learning-Path.git`
    
### 2. After cloning this repository on your machine, make sure to create your branch with the following format then check out to your branch
[First_Name].[Task].[PartNumber]

Example: `git checkout -b Blen.Task.1 `

### 3. After getting on your branch, copy the whole folder in the specific task you are in and rename it with your name.

### 4. Complete your tasks in the new folder and send a pull request. 
Note: If your solution is accepted, it will be merged, and you can move on to the next task and enjoy!!

## Objective

In the realm of user-content-based platforms, a key challenge is obtaining target users and data for MVP testing before the final product release. This step is critical for every startup's application production. To assess the impact of our functionalities and gather data in our MVP, we require active involvement from real-world users in significant numbers. Beyond social marketing efforts to attract users for testing and data, the application must be easily accessible to anyone. However, this accessibility becomes challenging if users need to install the right version of our application, adapt to a new UI, and put others through the same process when sharing our product.

Imagine a scenario where we integrate a lightweight version of our product into applications familiar to millions of our target customers, such as Telegram. This approach allows us to acquire a user base that will use our product, generate more content, and, when fully entering the market, join with an established customer base and real-world content. This is the rationale behind our Telegram bot learning phase in A2SV second year. It equips us with a crucial skill in software development.

In summary, Telegram bot development is an engaging pursuit for software enthusiasts. This phase is structured to provide each learner with the fundamentals of Telegram bot programming‚Äîa prerequisite for all A2SV-built products.
